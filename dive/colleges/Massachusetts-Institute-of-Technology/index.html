         MATCH
       </h3>
       <article>
          <h5>The Match Between You And MIT</h5>
          <p>Ask any admissions officer at MIT, and he or she will tell you that while grades and scores are important, it's really the match between applicant and Institute that drives our selection process. Understandably, we're often asked what is meant by "the match." Here are the key components.</p>
          <p>* <b>Alignment with MIT's mission to make the world a better place.</b> Remember that there are many ways to make the world better - we're not looking for applicants to have cured all infectious disease in the world by the time they're fifteen. Tutoring a single kid in math changes the world. Lobbying a senator to change bad policy changes the world. There are thousands of examples.</p>
          <p>* <b>Collaborative & cooperative spirit. </b>The core of the MIT spirit is collaboration and cooperation: you can see it all over the Institute. Many of the problem sets (our affectionate term for homework) at MIT are designed to be worked on in groups; cross-department labs are very common; MIT is known for its interdisciplinary research; the Open Source movement is powerful here; publishing and sharing of results is the center of academic research. Fostering a collaborative environment is an important part of the MIT community. If you enjoy working alone all the time, that's fine! But you're probably not going to be particularly happy here.</p>
          <p>* <b>Initiative. </b>Research projects and seed money and interesting lectures aren't simply handed to students on silver platters here. Opportunities abound at MIT, but they must be seized. For those students who take initiative - who take advantage of what's around them - MIT's resources are unparalleled.</p>
          <p>* <b>Risk-taking. </b>MIT wants to admit people who are not only planning to succeed but who are not afraid to fail. When people take risks in life, they learn resilience as a result - because risk leads to failure as often as it leads to success. The most creative and successful people - and MIT is loaded with them - know that failure is part of life and that if you stay focused and don't give up, goals are ultimately realized.</p>
          <p>* <b>Hands-on creativity.</b> MIT is an active, hands-on place. Innovation is risky and messy! Getting your hands dirty and trying something new is often the best way to achieve success. We apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems here; our Latin motto means "Mind and Hand." In other words, you shouldn't just enjoy thinking, you should also enjoy doing.</p>
          <p>* <b>Intensity, curiosity, and excitement. </b>(We used to summarize this as simply "passion" before various components of the college admissions machine turned it into a buzz-word and stripped it of its meaning.) In a nutshell: you should be invested in the things that really mean something to you (we're not particularly picky as to what). Explore! Choose quality over quantity - you don't have to do a million things to get into college. Put your heart into a few things that you truly care about and that will be enough.</p>
          <p>* <b>The character of the MIT community.</b> Our community is comprised of good people. People who take care of each other and lift each other up. People who inspire each other to work & dream beyond their potential. We're looking to admit people who by nature will sustain the qualities of this community.</p>
          <p>* <b>The ability to prioritize balance. Work hard, play hard. </b>Despite what you may have heard, this place is NOT all about work. To be successful here, you must prioritize some measure of downtime. Therefore, we like to see that you've prioritized some downtime in high school as well. Question #3a (Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it) is not a trick question. Answer it wisely.</p>
          <p>* <b>Last but not least, remember that no one profile - no matter how impressive - represents "the perfect match.</b>" When we admit a class of students to MIT, it's as if we're choosing a 1,100-person team to climb a very interesting, fairly rugged mountain - together. We obviously want people who have the training, stamina, and passion for the climb. At the same time, we want each to add something useful or intriguing to the team, from a wonderful temperament or sense of humor to compelling personal experiences, to a wide range of individual gifts, talents, interests and achievements. We are emphatically not looking for a batch of identical perfect climbers; we are looking for a richly varied team of capable people who will support, surprise and inspire each other.</p>

         PREPARE
       </h3>
       <h5>Preparing yourself for MIT, then, means doing two things:</h5>
       <ol>
         <li>making sure you're ready to do the work, and</li>
         <li>taking the time to really explore things that interest you, both inside and outside of school.</li>
       </ol>
        <h5>your high school years include the following:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>One year of high school physics </li>
          <li>One year of high school chemistry</li>
          <li>One year of high school biology</li>
          <li>Math, through calculus</li>
          <li>Two years of a foreign language</li>
          <li>Four years of English</li>
          <li>Two years of history and/or social sciences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue and challenge you</p>
        <p>Go out of your way to find projects, activities and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, that please you so much you don't mind the work involved.</p>
        <p>pursuing the things you love, growing, changing, taking risks, learning from your mistakes, all in your own distinctive way. College is not a costume party; you're not supposed to come dressed as someone else. Instead, college is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you've ever been. What you need to show us is that you're ready to try.</p>
        <p>challenged themselves in high school and have taken advantage of their opportunities</p>

       Credit for Previous Study: College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations
MIT grants credit for a score of 5 on some College Board Advanced Placement (AP) exams (see list below). It does not grant credit for secondary school courses teaching AP curricula, or partial credit for lower scores. If you take an AP exam more than once, only your higher score will be counted.
Matriculated students whose AP scores do not earn credit may attempt Advanced Standing Exams in Math and Science areas.
Policies on credit for AP scores are reviewed for each entering class and may change by the time you apply to MIT.
The College Board reports scores electronically to MIT. You may designate MIT as a recipient (code 3514) when you register for your AP exams, or order a report later from the College Board. MIT will not accept scores from paper reports sent to you, or from your high school.
AP Exams that Earn MIT Credit with Score of 5
Mathematics and Computer Science
AP Calculus BC: credit for 18.01 Calculus I
A score of 5 on the AP Calculus AB exam or the AB subsection of the BC exam places you in 18.01A/18.02A, the accelerated firstyear Calculus sequence.
No credit is given for scores on the AP Computer Science A or AP Statistics exams.
Sciences
AP Physics C (score of 5 on both Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism): credit for 8.01 Physics I
No credit is given for scores on the AP Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Physics 1, or Physics 2 exams.
Arts, English, History & Social Sciences, World Languages & Cultures
All AP exams listed in these categories by the College Board: 9 units of unrestricted elective credit.
AP Capstone
A score of 5 on both of the Capstone exams, AP Seminar and AP Research, earns a total of 9 units of unrestricted elective credit.
